# Algorithms and Data Structures Practice in C and C++

A repository of solutions to problems I solved myself or together with a study partner, as part of a bootcamp.  
The solutions are written in C and C++ languages, organized by topics.

## Covered Topics:
- **Arrays (11 problems)** - Two Sum, Product Except Self, Majority Element, Peak Element, Triplets Sum, Quadruplets Sum, Wiggle Sort, Subarray problems
- **Linked Lists (6 problems)** - Adding numbers, cycle detection, reversing sublist, rotating list, swapping nodes, odd-even grouping
- **Strings (10 problems)** - Roman numerals, fraction conversion, expression evaluation, digit decoding, Count-and-Say, subsequence check, zigzag pattern, Excel conversion, IP addresses, longest substring
- **Dynamic Programming (6 problems)** - Edit distance, stock profit, house robber, grid paths, largest square
- **Mathematical Algorithms (8 problems)** - Power, division, prime counting, bitwise operations, factorials, water jug, gas station circuit
- **Searching & Sorting (4 problems)** - Search in rotated array, find positions in sorted array, median of two arrays, first bad version
- **Graphs (3 problems)** - Islands counting, course scheduling with topological sort, course completion feasibility
- **Trees (4 problems)** - Binary tree right side view, BST validation, preorder serialization validation, house robber in tree
- **Backtracking (1 problem)** - Valid combinations with sum
- **Hash Tables** - Ready for future solutions

## Difficulty Rating:
🟢 **Easy** - Basic problems, simple algorithms
🟡 **Medium** - Intermediate problems, require algorithmic thinking
🔴 **Hard** - Advanced problems, complex algorithms

💡 **Repository Purpose:** Practice, improve understanding, and experience with basic data structures and algorithms.
